## Welcome to WinMan!

Welcome to winman, the website made by the unixgang that takes your sh**-looking unix desktop and make it a [beauty](https://jacobgoldstein.tk/rices). We specialize in window managers like `i3` and `xmonad`. If you need help feel free to use the contact page which will be made in a while. I hope you enjoy making your desktop look nice!
